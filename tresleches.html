  <h1>Tres Leches Recipe</h1>
    <p>Tres Leches Cake is a popular Mexican dessert that is known for its moist and creamy texture. It is made by soaking a sponge cake in a mixture of three types of milk: whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk. The cake is then topped with whipped cream and can be garnished with fresh fruit or caramel sauce [1].
    
    Here is a simple recipe for Tres Leches Cake:</p>
   <li><strong>Ingredients:</strong></li>
    
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Milk Mixture:</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream Topping:</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
      


      <li><strong>Instructions:</strong></li>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a separate large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar until pale and creamy. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg yolk mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>While the cake is baking, prepare the milk mixture by whisking together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a fork or skewer, poke holes all over the cake.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, making sure to evenly distribute it.</li>
        <li>Allow the cake to cool completely and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture.</li>
        <li>Before serving, prepare the whipped cream topping by beating the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Spread the whipped cream over the chilled cake and garnish as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve chilled and enjoy!</li>
