  <h1>Tres Leches Recipe
    Tres Leches Cake is a popular Mexican dessert that is known for its moist and creamy texture. It is made by soaking a sponge cake in a mixture of three types of milk: whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk. The cake is then topped with whipped cream and can be garnished with fresh fruit or caramel sauce [1].
    
    Here is a simple recipe for Tres Leches Cake:
    </h1>
    <p>
    Ingredients:
    
    1 cup all-purpose flour
    1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    5 large eggs, separated
    1 cup granulated sugar, divided
    1/3 cup whole milk
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    Milk Mixture:
    
    1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk
    1 can (12 ounces) evaporated milk
    1/2 cup whole milk
    Whipped Cream Topping:
    
    1 1/2 cups heavy cream
    3 tablespoons powdered sugar
    1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    </p>
    <h2>
    Instructions:
    
    Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish.
    In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.
    In a separate large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3/4 cup of the granulated sugar until pale and creamy. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract.
    Gradually add the dry ingredients to the egg yolk mixture and mix until well combined.
    In another large bowl, beat the egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form.
    Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cake batter until just combined.
    Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula.
    Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
    While the cake is baking, prepare the milk mixture by whisking together the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and whole milk in a bowl.
    Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.
    Using a fork or skewer, poke holes all over the cake.
    Slowly pour the milk mixture over the cake, making sure to evenly distribute it.
    Allow the cake to cool completely and then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, to allow the cake to absorb the milk mixture.
    Before serving, prepare the whipped cream topping by beating the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
    Spread the whipped cream over the chilled cake and garnish as desired.
    Serve chilled and enjoy!
    Note: Tres Leches Cake can be made 1-2 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator. The longer it sits, the more the cake will absorb the milk mixture and become moist and flavorful .
