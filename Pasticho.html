    <li>1/2 cup (120 milliliters) red wine or beef stock</li>

    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (9 grams) fresh basil, finely chopped, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Pasos:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and cook until softened and fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned. Break up the meat with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
      <li>Season the meat with salt and pepper, then add the tomato paste, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and red wine or beef stock. Stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Add the whole, peeled tomatoes to the skillet, breaking them up with a spoon. Stir in the dried oregano, granulated sugar, bay leaf, and chopped basil.</li>
      <li>Simmer the meat sauce for about 30 minutes, or until thickened and flavorful. Remove the bay leaf before assembling the Pasticho.</li>
      <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter for the béchamel sauce over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to form a roux.</li>
      <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, making sure there are no lumps. Cook the sauce, stirring constantly, until thickened and smooth.</li>
      <li>Stir in the ground nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
      <li>To assemble the Pasticho, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Add a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top.</li>
      <li>Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of béchamel sauce and grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Bake the Pasticho in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
      <li>Remove the Pasticho from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil, if desired.</li>
